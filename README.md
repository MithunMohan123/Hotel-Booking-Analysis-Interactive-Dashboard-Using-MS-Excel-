# Hotel Booking Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation using MS Excel)

## Project Objective
Analyze hotel booking data to understand booking trends, cancellations, and customer preferences to improve decision-making and optimize booking strategies.

## Dataset Used
- <a href=”https://github.com/MithunMohan123/Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Interactive-Dashboard-Using-MS-Excel-/blob/main/hotel_bookings.xlsx”> Hotel Booking Data </a>

## Questions (KPIs) Addressed
1. Compare total bookings and cancellations for City Hotels and Resort Hotels.
2. Identify which guest type (Couples, Families, Singles) experiences the highest cancellation rate.
3. Understand the relationship between desired and undesired room bookings versus cancellations.
4. Analyze monthly trends in bookings and cancellations.
5. Determine the total number of bookings and cancellations across the dataset.
6. Understand the proportion of City Hotel versus Resort Hotel cancellations.

## Process
1. Verified data for missing values, anomalies, and ensured consistency in formatting.
2. Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
3. Created pivot tables and visualizations to address the key questions.
4. Combined all visualizations into an interactive dashboard with slicers for dynamic exploration.

## Project Insights
- Total bookings amount to **119,390**, with **44,224 cancellations**.
- **Resort Hotels** have higher cancellations compared to City Hotels.
- **Couples** make the majority of bookings and cancellations, followed by **Families** and **Singles**.
- Desired rooms have significantly more bookings compared to undesired rooms, but undesired rooms show a higher cancellation rate proportionally.
- The highest booking and cancellation activity occurs in the months of **May and August**.

## Final Conclusion
To reduce cancellations and improve booking satisfaction:
- Focus on increasing the desirability of currently "undesired" room categories.
- Pay special attention to **Couples** as they make up the largest guest segment with cancellations.
- Evaluate seasonal patterns (e.g., May and August) and offer promotions or incentives during these peak periods to retain bookings.
